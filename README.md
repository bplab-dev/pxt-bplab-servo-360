## Blocks

### üîç Summary: What each block does

| **Block ID**                 | **Function**                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| [`spinOneWay`](#1-spin-one-way-block) | Spin motor in one direction at full speed |
| [`spinOtherWay`](#2-spin-other-way-block) | Spin motor in opposite direction at full speed |
| [`spinOneWayWithSpeed`](#3-spin-one-way-with-speed-block) | Spin motor in one direction with variable speed |
| [`spinOtherWayWithSpeed`](#4-spin-other-way-with-speed-block) | Spin motor in opposite direction with variable speed |
| [`turnOffMotor`](#5-turn-off-motor-block) | Turn off the motor |

### 1. Spin One Way Block

* üîπ Description
  * Spins the servo motor in one direction at full speed
  * Default pin is P1

* ‚úÖ Usage example

  ```blocks
  // Spin motor at full speed
  servo360.spinOneWay(AnalogPin.P1)
  ```

### 2. Spin Other Way Block

* üîπ Description
  * Spins the servo motor in the opposite direction at full speed
  * Default pin is P1

* ‚úÖ Usage example

  ```blocks
  // Spin motor in opposite direction
  servo360.spinOtherWay(AnalogPin.P1)
  ```

### 3. Spin One Way With Speed Block

* üîπ Description
  * Spins the motor in one direction with variable speed
  * Speed range: 0 to 100
  * Default pin is P1, default speed is 50

* ‚úÖ Usage example

  ```blocks
  // Spin at 75% speed
  servo360.spinOneWayWithSpeed(AnalogPin.P1, 75)
  ```

### 4. Spin Other Way With Speed Block

* üîπ Description
  * Spins the motor in the opposite direction with variable speed
  * Speed range: 0 to 100
  * Default pin is P1, default speed is 50

* ‚úÖ Usage example

  ```blocks
  // Spin opposite way at 25% speed
  servo360.spinOtherWayWithSpeed(AnalogPin.P1, 25)
  ```

### 5. Turn Off Motor Block

* üîπ Description
  * Turns off the motor at the specified pin
  * Default pin is P1

* ‚úÖ Usage example

  ```blocks
  // Turn off the motor
  servo360.turnOffMotor(AnalogPin.P1)
  ```
